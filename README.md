# RFID Sensor Platform (RSP) Software Toolkit  
  
This repository hosts reference design software projects that showcase 
the capabilities of the Intel® RFID Sensor Platform (Intel® RSP).
For best experience, be sure your RSP has a software version greater
than 53.2.

The gateway project demonstrates the use of the API to collect and 
process RFID tag read information.

The sensor-nfc-config project is a reference design for programming 
identification assets into the Intel® RSP for authenticating with the gateway.
