# RFID Sensor Platform (RSP) Software Toolkit  
  
This repository hosts reference design software projects that showcase 
the capabilities of the Intel速 RFID Sensor Platform (Intel速 RSP).
For best experience, be sure your RSP has a software version greater
than 53.2.

The gateway project demonstrates the use of the API to collect and 
process RFID tag read information.

The sensor-nfc-config project is a reference design for programming 
identification assets into the Intel速 RSP for authenticating with the gateway.

The rsp-sim tool is a set of scripts that simulate the commands, responses
and data notifications of the Intel速 RSP. This tool allows developers to begin
working with the gateway project prior to receiving actual hardware.
