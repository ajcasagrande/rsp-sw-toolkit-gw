# Intel&reg; RSP Constoller

The features and functionality included in this reference design are 
intended to showcase the capabilities of the Intel® RFID Sensor Platform (Intel® RSP) 
by demonstrating the use of the API to collect and process RFID tag read information.  

##### _THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE END-TO-END INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SOLUTION._  

The Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application is a Java application built with Gradle. As such, it can run on any OS that supports 
a Java Runtime Environment version 8 or greater. The following instructions will get you a copy 
of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  

#### Getting Started Windows

Instructions for build and installation in a Windows environment can be found in the 
[Installation & User's Guide](docs/Intel-RSP-Controller-App_Installation_User_Guide.pdf)

#### Getting Started Linux (recommended)
The following instructions assume an Ubuntu 18.04 installation.


##### Download (Linux)
```bash
#-- install development dependencies
sudo apt-get install default-jdk git gradle

#-- install runtime dependencies
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients avahi-daemon ssh

#-- install and configure network time server on the local machine
sudo apt-get install ntp
echo "server 127.127.1.0 prefer" | sudo tee -a /etc/ntp.conf
echo "fudge 127.127.22.1" | sudo tee -a /etc/ntp.conf
sudo systemctl status ntp

#-- create expected directories for the use case examples and documentation
mkdir -p ~/projects

#-- clone the reference source code
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/intel/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw.git
```

##### Build / Deploy (Linux)
```bash
cd ~/projects/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw

#-- the gradle build script will trigger a full build
#-- and a local deployment to the directory ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw 
#-- with the following command
gradle clean deploy

#-- !!!! CERTIFICATES ARE NEEDED !!!!
#-- the sensors connect securely to the gateway using a self signed certificate.
#-- a convenience script will generate these credentials in order to get the
#-- reference deployment up and running quickly.
mkdir -p ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/cache
cd ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/cache
~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/gen_keys.sh
```

##### Run (Linux)
A shell script is provided to start the application in the foreground. 
```bash
cd ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw
~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/run.sh
```
Connect an Intel&reg; RFID Sensor Platform on the same network segment as the Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application. 
The sensor will listen for the RSP Controller Application's mDNS announcement and initiate a connection. 
As the senor's connect, the RSP Controller Application will schedule them to read RFID tags in sequence
(one at a time).

##### Monitor

###### --- Web Admin http://localhost:8080/web-admin/
The Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application provides a web based administration interface for configuration and monitoring. 
The home page is a dashboard presenting status of several components including 
the number of sensors connected and a summary of the number of tags being read.

###### --- Command Line Interface
The Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application provides a command line interface (CLI) for configuration and monitoring.  
To view available commands, press enter at the prompt.  
To view command help, enter the command and press enter.  
To view available parameters or completion options, press the tab key.

Connect to the CLI and explore as follows.
```bash
ssh -p5222 console@localhost
password: console
    
#-- view sensor information 
cli> sensor show

```

###### --- MQTT
Open a terminal window and subscribe to the upstream events topic in order to monitor 
tag events as produced by the Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application.

```bash
#-- monitor the upstream events topic
mosquitto_sub -t rfid/controller/events
```
