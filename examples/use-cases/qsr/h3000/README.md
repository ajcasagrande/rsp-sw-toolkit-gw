## Goals
- Manage a deployment with two separate locations of interest ... Receiving-Exiting and Freezer.
  - This will be done by assigning different aliases to the two different sensors.
- Know when tagged items come into the restaurant.
- Know the location of a tagged item (sensor and facility).
  - This will be done by setting a facility and the aliases for the sensors.
- Know when a tagged item has moved from Receiving-Exiting to the Freezer or vice-versa.
  - Using different aliases for the different sensors will generate events when tags move between them
- Know when a tagged item has left the restaurant.
  - This will be done by setting the personality of a sensor to EXIT to determine tag departures.
  
__By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to track a tag as it arrives through Receiving-Exiting, 
transitions to Freezer, and then departs out the exit (Receiving-Exiting).__

## Prerequisites
1. You have an [H3000 DevKit](https://www.atlasrfidstore.com/intel-rsp-h3000-integrated-rfid-reader-development-kit/), 
or an equivalent setup.

2. You have completed the setup described in the 
[Get Started with IntelÂ® RFID Sensor Platform on Linux* Guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-intel-rfid-sensor-platform-on-linux).
3. The Intel&reg; RSP Controller application (hereafter referred to as RSP Controller) is [running](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-intel-rfid-sensor-platform-on-linux-run-the-intel-rfid-sensor-platform-controller-application).

4. The H3000 sensors are connected to the RSP Controller.

5. Select an RFID tag that is labeled with its value (see image below).  __Place that tag under your computer.__    
![sample tag](../../resources/common_images/sample_tag.png)

6. Remove all other tags from the room.  

7. The sensors are positioned in an optimal setting.  Face them away from each other, point them in different 
directions, and space them at least 3-5 feet apart.

## Terminology and Concepts
| Term | Definition |
| :------ | :------ |
| Project Directory | This is the directory where the cloned rsp-sw-toolkit-gw repo contents reside (the default location is ~/projects/).  This directory contains this file and the files needed to do this use-case.  In the following instructions, the default location will be used. |
| Deploy Directory | This is the directory where the Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application gets deployed (the default location is ~/deploy/).  In the following instructions, the default location will be used. |
| Sensor/Device ID | This is the unique identifier for each sensor.  The ID consists of "RSP-" followed by the last 6 characters of that sensor's MAC address.  The MAC Address is located on the sensor's label.  Based on the following image, the sensor ID would be RSP-1508e4.  ![Hx000 MAC](../../resources/common_images/sensor_mac.png) |
| Personality | This is an optional attribute that can be assigned to the sensors. It is utilized by the RSP Controller to generate specific types of tag events. |
| Alias | An alias can be used to identify a specific sensor/antenna-port combination.  This tuple is used to identify the location of tags in the inventory. The alias allows you to give meaningful names (like DryGoods or Freezer) for the locations as opposed to using sensor and antenna IDs.  The default value is the sensor ID followed by a hyphen followed by the antenna port number, for example RSP-1508e4-0. |
| Facility | This is used to define zones that consist of one or more sensors.  A typical deployment/location will consist of one facility. |
| Behavior | A collection of low-level RFID settings that dictates how the sensor operates. |
| Cluster | A grouping of one or more sensors that share the same set of configurations (facility, personality, alias, and behavior). |
| Tag State | A particular condition that describes the tag's current status.  The most common states for tags are present, exiting, and departed. |
| Tag Event | This is generated when a tag transitions between states.  The most common events are arrival, departed, and moved. |

## Configure / Control the Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application
To configure and use the RSP Controller, one of the main components is the cluster file.  The cluster 
file specifies: 
- How sensors should be grouped together.
- The facility(ies) to be used.
- What aliases should be assigned to the sensors' antenna ports (for unique/custom location reporting using meaningful names).
- Which personalities (if any) should be assigned to the sensors.
- Which behavior settings should be used.

__The cluster configuration file enables you to scale large deployments efficiently and quickly.__

### Cluster Configuration
You will need to edit the __qsr_config_cluster.json__ file __(located at ~/projects/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples/use-cases/qsr/h3000/)__ with new values to set up this use case: we want a single facility; two different aliases, one for each sensor (Freezer and Receiving-Exiting); an EXIT personality for the sensor labeled as Receiving-Exiting; and the appropriate behaviors.

![QSR H3000 Use Case](../../resources/qsr/h3000/3dStore_image2.png)

1. Open the the __qsr_config_cluster.json__ file __(located at ~/projects/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples/use-cases/qsr/h3000/)__  in your favorite editor.  You will see that the file is JSON formatted and consists of a cluster configuration ID and a list of clusters.  You will need to insert the appropriate values for each cluster.

2. Edit the various fields to configure the clusters.  The following steps explain each line of the clusters: 
    1. __id__: This is a unique ID used to identify the cluster group.  In this use case we will create two clusters, one for the Freezer and one for the Receiving-Exit, similar to what you see below.  You can keep the existing default values from the sample cluster file.<br>
    [![cluster_id](../../resources/qsr/h3000/cluster_config_id.png)](qsr_cluster_config_filled.json)
    2. __personality__: The location for the first cluster (FreezerCluster) will be internal to the store and doesn't need to be assigned any personality, so we will give it a value of __null__.  The location for the second cluster (Receiving-ExitingCluster) is being used to configure an "edge/boundary" location from where tags may leave the facility, so we will set the personality to __EXIT (MUST BE CAPITALIZED)__.  This will generate a "departed" event whenever a tag is removed from this cluster's location.<br>
    [![cluster_personality](../../resources/qsr/h3000/cluster_config_personality.png)](qsr_cluster_config_filled.json)
    3. __facility_id__: For most purposes, just a single facility is needed to encompass a deployment at a store.  We will set the facility_id to __QSR_Store_8402__ for both clusters.  
    [![cluster_facility](../../resources/qsr/h3000/cluster_config_facility.png)](qsr_cluster_config_filled.json)
    4. __aliases__: This attribute is used for setting meaningful names for locations.  For the first cluster, we will set the aliases to __Freezer__ and for the second cluster, set the aliases to __Receiving-Exit__.  For enhanced performance, the H3000 sensors have two linear antennas built into the same unit which cover the same location.  Instead of treating the two antennas as separate locations, we configure them as one location by giving them the same alias value per cluster.  
    [![cluster_aliases](../../resources/qsr/h3000/cluster_config_aliases.png)](qsr_cluster_config_filled.json)
    5. __behavior_id__: Behaviors are used to configure the low level RFID settings (Sensor Power Level, Session Flag, Singulation Algo, Dwell Time, etc.).  The RSP Controller comes with some preset behavior files, but for this exercise, we will use a custom file so we will be setting the behavior_id for both clusters to __behavior_PORTS_2__.  
    [![cluster_behavior](../../resources/qsr/h3000/cluster_config_behavior.png)](qsr_cluster_config_filled.json)<br>
       __NOTE:__  The behavior_PORTS_2 file has been optimized for this exercise.  Do NOT use this behavior file for production deployments.

    6. __sensor_groups__: This is where you identify which specific sensors are grouped together.  These sensor groups will be governed by the settings that we just configured in their respective cluster.  All sensors in each group will run at the same time.  If there are multiple sensor groups per cluster, each group will run sequentially.  In a large deployment, you may have many sensors that could interfere with each other (they cover the same area, they are facing each other, etc.).  You can place them in different groups so that they aren't running at the same time.<br/><div id="sensor_naming"></div>
      In this use-case, for each cluster, we will have one sensor group with a single sensor in it.  __You will need to use your actual sensor's ID in order for the controller application to function properly.__  To find the sensor ID of your sensor, see the label on the back of your sensor (see image below):<br/><br/>
      ![Sensor_Id_Image](../../resources/common_images/sensor_id_label.png)<br/>
      __NOTE: Sensor ID = "RSP-XXXXXX" where XXXXXX is the last six characters of the device MAC address.  The last six characters can only consist of numeric values zero through nine and alpha characters A through F [0-9,A-F].  See image above.__<br/><br/><div id="sample_cluster"></div>
      If done correctly, your cluster configuration file should now look like the following, except with your sensor IDs:  
      [![cluster_sensor](../../resources/qsr/h3000/cluster_config_sensor.png)](qsr_cluster_config_filled.json)  
        __NOTE: In this instance, although the sensors are in different groups, they are also in different clusters.  Since clusters are independent of each other, both sensors will end up running at the same time, so make sure to space the sensors apart and make them face away from each other as outlined and illustrated in [Step 7 in the Prerequisites section](#Prerequisites).__
    
3. (Optional) Now that the file is complete, it would be a good idea to pass the contents of the file through a JSON linter (such as https://jsonlint.com/, which is a convenient online JSON linting tool) to ensure your file has proper JSON formatting.

4. Save and close the updated cluster configuration file.

5. (Optional) This would be a good time to label your physical sensors with their sensor IDs and the aliases that you set in the cluster configuration file.  This makes it easier to follow and understand the output when you go through the tag movement/tracking exercise.

6. Choose one of the following methods to configure the RSP Controller. Each method will accomplish 
the same configuration tasks.

    - [METHOD 1: Using the Web Admin](#method-1-using-the-web-admin)
    - [METHOD 2: Using the MQTT Messaging API](#method-2-using-the-mqtt-messaging-api)

___

### METHOD 1: Using the Web Admin
1. Open the [Web Admin](http://localhost:8080/web-admin) and confirm that your two H3000 sensors 
are connected. This can be seen on the [Dashboard](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/dashboard.html) 
page or the [Sensors](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/sensors-main.html) page.  You can navigate between 
the different pages by using the menu button found at the top left of each page.

    ![Nav_Menu_Button](../../resources/common_images/RSP_Controller_WebAdmin_Dashboard_Nav.png)
<br/><br/>
2. On the [Scheduler](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/scheduler.html) page, stop the sensors from reading 
tags by pressing the __INACTIVE__ button.

    ![Scheduler_Inactive_Button](../../resources/common_images/RSP_Controller_WebAdmin_Scheduler_Inactivate.png)
<br/><br/>
3. On the [Inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page, press the __Unload__ button 
to clear out all previous tag history to start a clean session.

    ![Inventory_Unload_Button](../../resources/common_images/RSP_Controller_WebAdmin_Inventory_Unload.png)
<br/><br/>
4. On the [Behaviors](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/behaviors.html) page, use the __Upload From File__
button to upload all of the use case behaviors to the RSP Controller.  The behavior file can be found in the __~/projects/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples/use-cases/qsr/h3000/__ directory.  The required file is __behavior_PORTS_2.json__.<br>  
    ![Behaviors_Upload_Button](../../resources/common_images/RSP_Controller_WebAdmin_Behavior_Upload.png)
 
    __NOTE:__  This file __MUST__ be loaded to the RSP Controller __BEFORE__ the cluster configuration file 
    because the cluster configuration file references this behavior id, and the behavior must already be known by the 
    RSP Controller. Otherwise the loading of the cluster configuration file will fail validation.  

    Your list of behaviors should now include __"behavior_PORTS_2"__:
    
    ![Behaviors_after_load](../../resources/common_images/RSP_Controller_WebAdmin_Behavior_behavior_PORTS_2_Uploaded.png)
<br/><br/>
5. On the [Cluster Config](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/cluster-config.html) page, use the __Upload From File__ button to upload the __EDITED__ cluster configuration file (see the [Cluster Configuration section](#cluster-configuration)).

    ![Cluster_Config_Upload_Button](../../resources/common_images/RSP_Controller_WebAdmin_Cluster_Upload.png)

    The edited cluster configuration file can be found at __~/projects/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples/use-cases/qsr/h3000/qsr_cluster_config.json__ or wherever you saved it from the [Configure / Control the Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application](#configure--control-the-intel-rsp-controller-application) section.

    The cluster IDs (FreezerCluster and Receiving-ExitingCluster) will be displayed.  If you click on the cluster ID name, you should see the values that you set in the cluster configuration file.

    ![Cluster_Config_Upload_Button](../../resources/qsr/h3000/cluster_after_load.png)  
    __TROUBLESHOOTING:  If your Cluster Config page does not look like the image above than:__
    - Verify you successfully loaded the behavior file in the previous step.
    - Verify your cluster config file is valid.
        - Ensure your cluster config file has proper JSON formatting using the [JSON Linting tool](https://jsonlint.com/).
        - Make sure the values for the Sensor IDs follow the "RSP-XXXXXX" [naming convention](#sensor_naming).
        - Make sure to capitalize the word "EXIT" for the cluster with the EXIT personality.
        - Make sure the only differences between your cluster config file and the [sample seen above](#sample_cluster) are your Sensor IDs.
    - Try maximizing your browser window.
<br/><br/>
6. On the [Scheduler](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/scheduler.html) page, start the sensors reading 
according to the cluster configuration by pressing the __FROM_CONFIG__ button.

    ![Scheduler_From_Config_Button](../../resources/common_images/RSP_Controller_WebAdmin_Scheduler_FromConfig.png)
    
    The __Cluster Id__, __Behavior__ name and __Sensor__ ID will be displayed on the page (see image below).

    ![Scheduler_After_Confile_File_Load](../../resources/qsr/h3000/scheduler_after_load.png)
<br/><br/>
7. On the [Sensors](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/sensors-main.html) page, confirm that the sensors have 
been configured as specified in the cluster configuration file (have the correct behavior, facility, personality, 
and aliases) and are reading tags.  Your sensor page should look like the following except with your respective sensor IDs.

    ![Sensor_After_Config_File_Load](../../resources/qsr/h3000/sensors_after_load.png)
  
     ![Sensor_Connected_Icon](../../resources/common_images/sensor_icon_connected.png) Connected  
     ![Sensor_NotConnected_Icon](../../resources/common_images/sensor_icon_disconnected.png)  Disconnected  
     ![Sensor_Reading_Icon](../../resources/common_images/sensor_icon_reading.png)  Reading tags
   
   __TROUBLESHOOTING:  If your sensor page does not look like the image above than:__
     - __Make sure the cluster configuration file is valid.  Check the steps you performed in the [Configure / Control the Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application](#configure--control-the-intel-rsp-controller-application) section.__
     - __Check the steps you performed in the [METHOD 1: Using the Web Admin](#method-1-using-the-web-admin)__
     - __Check our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://01.org/rsp-sw-toolkit/faq-0)__  

8. Navigate to the [Inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page which can be used 
to monitor tag reads and states.
9. Continue to the [Observe Tag Events section](#observe-tag-events).

___

### METHOD 2: Using the MQTT Messaging API
1. Edit the __mqtt_set_cluster_config.json__ file  (located at ~/projects/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples/use-cases/qsr/h3000/) replacing __CONTENTS_OF_CLUSTER_CONFIG_GO_HERE__ with the contents of your edited __qsr_cluster_config.json file__ (Make sure you completed the [Cluster Configuration](#cluster-configuration) section).   

    Copy and paste the contents of the mqtt_set_cluster_config.json file through a JSON linter (such as https://jsonlint.com/) to ensure your file has proper JSON formatting. 

    Save and close the __mqtt_set_cluster_config.json__ file. 

2. Open a terminal window and subscribe to the RSP Controller's command response topic in order to monitor the 
command responses.  For the purposes of this exercise, we will call this the __"Response Terminal"__.
    ```bash
    #-- monitor the rpc command responses
    mosquitto_sub -t rfid/controller/response
    ```

3. Open another terminal to send JSON-RPC commands over MQTT to configure and control the RSP Controller.  For the purposes of this exercise, we will call this the __"Command Terminal"__.
    ```bash
    #-- change directory to the examples folder 
    #-- so the example commands work correctly
    cd ~/projects/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples
    ```

4. Inactivate the sensors by stopping the RSP Controller Scheduler.<br>
   Execute the following in the __Command Terminal__:
   ```bash
   #-- stop the scheduler
   mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f api/upstream/scheduler_set_run_state_request_INACTIVE.json
   ```

   You should see the following output in the __Response Terminal__:
   ```bash
   {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"24","result":{"run_state":"INACTIVE","available_states":["INACTIVE","ALL_ON","ALL_SEQUENCED","FROM_CONFIG"],"clusters":[]}}
   ```

   RSP Sensor(s) LED indicator should show solid yellow color.

4. Unload the inventory data.<br>
   Execute the following in the __Command Terminal__:
   ```bash
   #-- unload the current inventory
   mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f api/upstream/inventory_unload_request.json
   ```

   You should see the following output in the __Response Terminal__:
   ```bash
   {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"16","result":null}
   ```

5. Load the rfid behavior settings specific to this exercise.<br>
   Execute the following in the __Command Terminal__:
   ```bash
   #-- (lowered power levels as sensors are likely to be interfering)
   mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f use-cases/qsr/h3000/mqtt_set_behavior.json
   ```

   You should see the following output in the __Response Terminal__:
   ```bash
   {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","result":[{"id":"behavior_PORTS_2","operation_mode":"NonContinuous","link_profile":1,"power_level":18.0,"selected_state":"Any","session_flag":"S0","target_state":"A","q_algorithm":"Dynamic","fixed_q_value":10,"start_q_value":7,"min_q_value":3,"max_q_value":15,"retry_count":0,"threshold_multiplier":2,"dwell_time":1000,"inv_cycles":0,"toggle_target_flag":false,"repeat_until_no_tags":false,"perform_select":false,"perform_post_match":false,"filter_duplicates":false,"auto_repeat":false,"delay_time":0,"toggle_mode":"OnInvCycle"}]}
   ```

6. Load (set) the cluster configuration.<br>
   Execute the following in the __Command Terminal__:
   ```bash
   #-- load (set) the cluster configuration
   mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f use-cases/qsr/h3000/mqtt_set_cluster_config.json
   ```

   You should see the following output in the __Response Terminal__:
   ```bash
   {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"4","result":{"id":"QsrUseCaseClusterConfigExample","clusters":[{"id":"FreezerCluster","personality":null,"facility_id":"QSR_Store_8402","aliases":["Freezer","Freezer"],"behavior_id":"behavior_PORTS_2","sensor_groups":[["RSP-150659"]],"tokens":[]},{"id":"Receiving-ExitingCluster","personality":"EXIT","facility_id":"QSR_Store_8402","aliases":["Receiving-Exiting","Receiving-Exiting"],"behavior_id":"behavior_PORTS_2","sensor_groups":[["RSP-150994"]],"tokens":[]}]}}
   ```

7. Activate the scheduler in to utilize the settings in the cluster configuraiton.<br>
   Execute the following in the __Command Terminal__:
   ```bash
   #-- activate the scheduler in custom configuration mode
   mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f api/upstream/scheduler_set_run_state_request_FROM_CONFIG.json
   ```

   You should see the following output in the __Response Terminal__:
   ```bash
   {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"24","result":{"run_state":"FROM_CONFIG","available_states":["INACTIVE","ALL_ON","ALL_SEQUENCED","FROM_CONFIG"],"clusters":[{"id":"FreezerCluster","personality":null,"facility_id":null,"aliases":[],"behavior_id":"behavior_PORTS_2","sensor_groups":[],"tokens":[]},{"id":"Receiving-ExitingCluster","personality":null,"facility_id":null,"aliases":[],"behavior_id":"behavior_PORTS_2","sensor_groups":[],"tokens":[]}]}}
   ```
   RSP Sensor(s) LED indicator will show solid blue or blinking blue color when reading rfid tags.

   __TROUBLESHOOTING:__  
    - If you see an error message when you try to execute any of the commands than:
        - Verify you are in the correct path or directory.  By default, the sample commands are located in the ~/projects/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples directory.  Your directory may differ if you selected a different location.
        - Verify the command was entered correctly.
       
    - If you see an error in the response message (i.e. UNKNOWN error or PARSE_ERROR) or the response message does not match the examples above, verify your mqtt_set_cluster_config.json and mqtt_set_behavior.json files are valid.
        - Make sure your modified cluster configuration file is correct and the JSON format is valid.  See the [Cluster Configuration](#cluster-configuration) section.
        - Ensure you edited the mqtt_set_cluster_config.json file as described in [step 1](#method-2-using-the-mqtt-messaging-api).
  

8. Continue to the [Observe Tag Events section](#observe-tag-events).
___

## Observe Tag Events
1.  Open a terminal window and subscribe to the RSP Controller events MQTT topic in order to monitor 
tag events as produced by the RSP Controller.

    ```bash
    #-- monitor the upstream events topic
    mosquitto_sub -t rfid/controller/events
    ```

    __NOTE:__  All of the output seen below is based on the default values from the included configuration files.  
If you changed the default values, your results may differ slightly.

2. ### Tag arrival in Receiving-Exiting
    At this point, remove one tag from hiding and place it nearby the Receiving-Exiting sensor. 
    When the tag is read initially, an arrival event will be generated on the rfid/controller/events topic.
    Verify from the Web Admin 
    [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page that the tag is now in the EXITING
    state and the location is at the Receiving-Exiting sensor.

    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.
    ![QSR H3000 Output 1](../../resources/qsr/h3000/out_1.png)
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "inventory_event",
      "params": {
        "sent_on": 1559867406651,
        "device_id": "intel-acetest",
        "data": [
          {
            "facility_id": "QSR_Store_8402",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "arrival",
            "timestamp": 1559867406524,
            "location": "Receiving-Exiting"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    If you do not see the expected event, please confirm that
    - The cluster file was edited properly with the correct sensor ID (see the [Cluster Configuration 
    section](#cluster-configuration))
    - The cluster file was uploaded correctly
    - The scheduler is using that cluster configuration

3. ### Tagged item is moved to Freezer (departure from Receiving-Exiting and arrival in Freezer)
    Now move the tag from the Receiving-Exiting sensor to the Freezer sensor. Since these sensors are in 
    the same facility, a 'moved' event will be generated. It may take a few moments for the event(s) to be 
    generated as the algorithm uses time-weighted RSSI averages to determine the tag location. From the 
    [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page, confirm that the tag has changed 
    locations to the second sensor (Freezer) and that the tag state has changed to PRESENT.

    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.
    ![QSR H3000 Output 2](../../resources/qsr/h3000/out_2.png)
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "inventory_event",
      "params": {
        "sent_on": 1559867429368,
        "device_id": "intel-acetest",
        "data": [
          {
            "facility_id": "QSR_Store_8402",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "moved",
            "timestamp": 1559867428832,
            "location": "Freezer"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

4. ### Tagged item is staged for trashing (departure from Freezer and arrival in Receiving-Exiting)
    Now move the tag back to the Receiving-Exiting sensor.  Again, since the two sensors are in the same 
    facility, there will be another "moved" event, this time ending up at Receiving-Exiting. Again, this can 
    take a few moments to occur. From the [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) 
    page, confirm that the location changes back to Receiving-Exiting and the tag's state changes to EXITING.

    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.

          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

5. ### Tagged item is taken out to trash (departure from Receiving-Exiting)
    Hide the tag so that no sensor is able to read it to emulate the tag actually being gone. After the departure 
    threshold time limit has passed (default being 30 seconds), a departed event should be generated from the 
    Receiving-Exiting sensor.  From the [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) 
    page, confirm that the state changes to DEPARTED_EXIT.

    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.

## Summary
![GoldStar](../../resources/common_images/goldstar-sm.png) Congratulations!  You have completed this tutorial that demonstrates how to configure the Intel&reg; RSP solution for a typical quick service restaurant deployment.

By applying the cluster configuration setting, you should have seen how to track a tag across various locations and how it generates different events.  You should now have the knowledge and ability to scale for a larger deployment by adding additional sensors. 

## Next Steps
- [Start a clean session](#starting-a-clean-session) and try a different method to configure the RSP Controller:  
  - [METHOD 1: Using the Web Admin](#method-1-using-the-web-admin)  
  - [METHOD 2: Using the MQTT Messaging API](#method-2-using-the-mqtt-messaging-api)  
- Additional information is available in the [Intel&reg; RSP Get Started Guide Next Steps section](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-intel-rfid-sensor-platform-on-linux-next-steps)

## Starting a Clean Session
If you would like to start another use case, try another configuration method, or would like to run 
your own scenario, than you will want to start with a clean session for the RSP Controller so that 
old data and configurations do not pollute your next exercise.  In order to do this, follow these steps:

1. Stop the RSP Controller.  If you used the installer to install the RSP Controller, and you used 
the native installation (non-Docker method), than simply press Ctrl+C in the terminal window where 
you ran the installer script.

2. Run the following commands to clear out the old data and configurations
    ```bash
    cd ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/cache/
    rm -rf *.json

    cd ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/config/behaviors/
    rm -rf behavior_PORTS_*
    ```

3. Start the RSP Controller by running the following commands
    ```bash
    cd ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/
    ./run.sh
    ```

Now you should have a clean session from which you can run any new scenario without worry of data 
or configuration pollution.
