![QSR H1000 Use Case](./QSR_H1000.png)

This use case demonstrates configuring the Intel&reg; RSP H1000 Devkit Sensor and Intel&reg; RSP 
Controller Application as deployed in a typical quick serve restaurant (qsr) environment.

## Goals
- Manage a deployment with two separate cold storage rooms, using one H1000 sensor and two antennas
- Know when tagged items come into either cold room
- Determine the location of a tagged item (sensor and facility)
- Know when items potentially move between the cold rooms
- Know when items leave either of the cold rooms
  
By the end of the example, you will be able to track tags as they move in and out of the different 
cold rooms.

## Prerequisites
1. It is assumed that the Intel&reg; RSP Controller application (hereafter referred to as RSP Controller) 
is already running and the sensor has its antennas attached, is running, and is connected to the RSP Controller.

2. Hide the Tags  
Make sure no tags are visible to the sensors in order to see a complete use case scenario.  You can hide the 
tags by enclosing them in some metallic material, like a metal box or some aluminum foil.  You can also hide 
the tags under a laptop or computer.

## Configure / Control the Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application
To configure and use the RSP Controller, one of the main components is the cluster file.  The cluster 
file specifies how the sensors should be grouped together, which behavior settings should be used, which 
personalities (if any) should be assigned to the sensors, and what aliases should be assigned to the sensors' 
antenna ports (for unique/custom location reporting).

__Note:__ In the following instructions, the term YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY will refer to the directory where 
the cloned rsp-sw-toolkit-gw repo contents reside (the default location is ~/projects/), and the term 
YOUR_DEPLOY_DIRECTORY will refer to the directory where the Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application was 
deployed (the default location is ~/deploy/).

In the [DevkitRetailCluster.json](./DevkitRetailCluster.json) file (located at 
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples/use-cases/qsr/h1000/), edit the sensor device id in the 
sensor_groups to match the sensor included with the Devkit.  This cluster configuration file is an example 
that establishes the one facility (QSR_Store_8402).  It also creates aliases for the two antennas (Freezer 
and Refridgerator) in order to generate more natural locations names, as opposed to RSP-150004-0 and 
RSP-150004-1.  The sensor is configured with an EXIT personality in order to detect when an item leaves either 
of the cold rooms.  It also will assign the appropriate behaviors for reading the RFID tags.

After the cluster file has been edited and saved, choose one of the following methods to configure and control 
the RSP Controller. Each method accomplishes the same configuration tasks.

### USING THE WEB ADMIN
1. Open the [web admin](http://localhost:8080/web-admin) page and confirm that the sensor included in the 
dev kit is connected. This can be seen on the [dashboard](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/dashboard.html) 
page or the [sensors](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/sensors-main.html) page.  You can navigate between 
the different pages by using the menu button found at the top left of each page.

    ![Nav_Menu_Button](../../img_resources/Nav_Menu.png)

2. On the [scheduler](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/scheduler.html) page, stop the sensor from reading 
by pressing the INACTIVE button to set the run state to INACTIVE.

    ![Scheduler_Inactive_Button](../../img_resources/Scheduler_Inactive.png)

3. On the [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page, press the Unload button 
to clear out all previous tag history to start a clean session.

    ![Inventory_Unload_Button](../../img_resources/Inventory_Unload.png)

4. On the [behaviors](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/behaviors.html) page, use the Upload From File
button to upload the use case behavior to the RSP Controller.

    ![Behaviors_Upload_Button](../../img_resources/Behaviors_Upload.png)

    The behavior file can be found at 
    YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples/use-cases/qsr/h1000/DevkitQsrBehaviorExit_PORTS_2.json.  

    __NOTE:__  This file __MUST__ be loaded to the RSP Controller __BEFORE__ the cluster configuration 
    because the cluster file references that behavior id, and that behavior must already be known by the 
    RSP Controller. Otherwise the loading of the cluster configuration file will fail validation.

5. Upload the __edited__ cluster configuration file (see the "Configure / Control the Intel&reg; RSP Controller 
Application" section) using the [cluster config](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/cluster-config.html) page.

    ![Cluster_Config_Upload_Button](../../img_resources/Cluster_Config_Upload.png)

6. On the [scheduler](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/scheduler.html) page, start the sensor reading 
according to the cluster configuration by selecting the FROM_CONFIG run state.

    ![Scheduler_From_Config_Button](../../img_resources/Scheduler_From_Config.png)
    
    The clusters that the scheduler is using will be displayed on the page.

7. On the [sensors](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/sensors-main.html) page, confirm that the sensor has 
been configured as specified in the cluster configuration file (has the correct behavior, facility, personality, 
and aliases) and is reading tags.

8. Navigate to the [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page which can be used 
to monitor tag reads and states.

Continue to the [Observe Tag Events section](#observe-tag-events).
___

### USING THE MQTT MESSAGING API:
1. Edit [cluster_set_config_request_use_case_qsr.json](./cluster_set_config_request_use_case_qsr.json) 
replacing "CONTENTS_OF_CLUSTER_CONFIG_GO_HERE" with the contents of the edited DevkitQsrCluster.json file. 

2. Open a terminal window and subscribe to the RSP Controller's command response topic in order to monitor the 
command responses.
    ```bash
    #-- monitor the rpc command responses
    mosquitto_sub -t rfid/controller/response
    ```

3. Open another terminal to send JsonRPC commands over MQTT to configure and control the RSP Controller.
    ```bash
    #-- change directory to the examples folder 
    #-- so the example commands work correctly
    cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples
    
    #-- stop the scheduler
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f api/upstream/scheduler_set_run_state_request_INACTIVE.json
    
    #-- unload the current inventory
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f api/upstream/inventory_unload_request.json
    
    #-- load the behavior specific to this exercise
    #-- (lowered power level as antennas are likely interferring)
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f use-cases/qsr/h1000/behavior_put_request_Exit.json
    
    #-- load (set) the cluster configuration
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f use-cases/qsr/h1000/cluster_set_config_request_use_case_qsr.json
    
    #-- activate the scheduler in custom configuration mode
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f api/upstream/scheduler_set_run_state_request_FROM_CONFIG.json
    ```

Continue to the [Observe Tag Events section](#observe-tag-events).
___

## Observe Tag Events
Check that the antennas are not pointed in conflicting directions; keep the antennas separate and pointing 
away from each other as much as possible.

Open a terminal window and subscribe to the RSP Controller events topic in order to monitor tag events as 
produced by the RSP Controller.

```bash
#-- monitor the upstream events topic
mosquitto_sub -t rfid/controller/events
```

1. ##### Tag arrival in the first cold room
    At this point, remove a tag from hiding and place it nearby one of the two antennas. When the tag is  
    read initially, an arrival event will be generated on the rfid/controller/events topic. 
    Verify from the Web Admin 
    [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page that the tags are now in the 
    EXITING state and the location is at the first antenna's alias (either Freezer or Refridgerator).  
    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "inventory_event",
      "params": {
        "sent_on": 1559867406651,
        "device_id": "intel-acetest",
        "data": [
          {
            "facility_id": "QSR_Store_8402",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "arrival",
            "timestamp": 1559867406524,
            "location": "Freezer"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

2. ##### Tag moved to the other cold room
    Now take the tag and move it to the other antenna. Since these antennas are in the same facility, a 
    moved event will be generated. It may take a few moments for the event to be generated as the 
    algorithm uses time-weighted RSSI averages to determine tag location. From the 
    [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page, confirm that the tag's location 
    has changed to the other cold room.  
    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "inventory_event",
      "params": {
        "sent_on": 1559867488229,
        "device_id": "intel-acetest",
        "data": [
          {
            "facility_id": "QSR_Store_8402",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "moved",
            "timestamp": 1559867487834,
            "location": "Refridgerator"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

3. ##### Tag departure from the second cold room
    Now take that tag and hide it such that it can't be seen by either antenna.  After about 
    30 seconds, a departed event should be generated for the tag that was removed. From the 
    [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page, confirm that the tag 
    state of the removed tag has changed to DEPARTED_EXIT.  
    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.
    ```json  
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "inventory_event",
      "params": {
        "sent_on": 1559867527713,
        "device_id": "intel-acetest",
        "data": [
          {
            "facility_id": "QSR_Store_8402",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "departed",
            "timestamp": 1559867494569,
            "location": "Refridgerator"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
